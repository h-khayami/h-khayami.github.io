  abstract = {Joint encryption encoding schemes have been released to fulfill both reliability and security desires in a single step. Using Low Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes in joint encryption encoding schemes, as an alternative to classical linear codes, would shorten the key size as well as improving error correction capability. In this article, a joint encryption encoding scheme using Quasi-Cyclic Low Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) codes based on finite geometry is presented. It is observed that our proposed scheme not only outperforms its predecessors in key size and transmission rate, but also remains secure against all known cryptanalyses of code-based secret key cryptosystems. In this paper, we have proposed an idea to make QC-LDPC based cryptosystems secure against reaction attacks. It is subsequently shown that our scheme benefits from low computational complexity. By taking the advantage of QC-LDPC codes based on finite geometry, the key size of our scheme is very close to its target security level. In addition, using the proposed scheme, a wide range of desirable transmission rates are achievable. This variety of codes makes our cryptosystem suitable for a number of different communication and cryptographic standards such as wireless personal area networks (WPAN) and digital video broadcasting (DVB).},

  abstract={In this paper, a dynamic-hybrid automatic repeat request (D-HARQ) scheme with guaranteed delay performance is proposed. As opposed to the conventional HARQ that the maximum number of re-transmissions, L, is fixed, in the proposed scheme packets can be re-transmitted more times given that the previous packet was received with less than L re-transmissions. The dynamic of the proposed scheme is analyzed using the Markov model. For delay sensitive applications, the proposed scheme shows a superior performance in terms of packet error rate compared with the conventional HARQ and Fixed retransmission schemes when the channel state information is not available at the transmitter. We further show that D-HARQ achieves a higher throughput compared with the conventional HARQ and fixed re-transmission schemes under the same reliability constraint.},

  abstract={The explosive growth in users' demand in both areas of wireless communications and power generation has led to design of new key technologies that will be dominant in the near future; cognitive radio networks in communications and smart grid in power field. This paper proposes a novel scenario to marry these technologies together by using a cognitive radio ad hoc network (CRAHN) as the foundation of smart grid communications. It discusses formation and throughput of such a citywide network, the information transferred by the network, and how this structure can be relied upon in disasters, compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract={Due to rising value of energy supplies, the need for managing electrical energy sources becomes prominent. In this paper, a smart plug device is presented; which provides features to measure energy consumption and recognizes the type of attached electrical devices. Furthermore, the proposed framework enables home controller systems to monitor and control home energy consumption efficiently. Subsequently an analysis of energy consumption of a pilot house, prior and after the installation of the smart plug, based on a hypothetical scenario, is provided. The results present positive impacts of using the smart plug on energy consumption rate; especially during peak hours.},
