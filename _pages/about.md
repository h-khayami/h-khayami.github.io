**Innovator at the Intersection of AI, IoT, and Human-Centered Technology**

I am a **PhD researcher** in Electrical Engineering at the **University of Maryland**, driven by the challenge of integrating signal processing, machine learning, and human-centered AI systems. My work focuses on **Human Activity Recognition**, **wearable devices**, and designing **teachable AI** interfaces—empowering non-experts to adapt models to their needs with ease.
With a multi-faceted engineering background, I began my career exploring robotics, later expanding into **embedded systems, communications, IoT, and machine learning**. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to bridge disciplines, translating complex technical challenges into impactful, real-world solutions.

I hold an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology (2015) and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering (Communications) from the University of Tehran (2013).

My career has been defined by a commitment to never settling—continuously expanding my expertise to craft cutting-edge solutions across multiple domains. I believe innovation happens where disciplines converge, and I embrace that uniqueness in my work.
